# Swap Nodes

A binary tree is a tree which is characterized by one of the following properties:

* It can be empty (`null`).
* It contains a root node only.
* It contains a root node with a left subtree, a right subtree,
  or both. These subtrees are also binary trees.

In-order traversal is performed as

1. Traverse the left subtree.
2. Visit root.
3. Traverse the right subtree.

## Swapping

Swapping subtrees of a node means that if initially
node has left subtree `L` and right subtree `R`, then after swapping,
the left subtree will be `R` and the right subtree, `L`.

For example, in the following tree, we swap children of node `1`.

```
                                Depth
    1               1            [1]
   / \             / \
  2   3     ->    3   2          [2]
   \   \           \   \
    4   5           5   4        [3]
```

In-order traversal of left tree is `2 4 1 3 5`
and of right tree is `3 5 1 2 4`.

## Swap operation

We define depth of a node as follows:

* The root node is at depth `1`.
* If the depth of the parent node is `d`,
  then the depth of current node will be `d+1`.

Given a tree and an integer, `k`, in one operation,
we need to swap the subtrees of all the nodes at each depth `h`,
where `h âˆˆ [k, 2k, 3k,...]`. In other words, if `h` is a multiple
of `k`, swap the left and right subtrees of that level.

You are given a tree of n nodes where nodes are indexed from
`[1..n]` and it is rooted at `1`. You have to perform `t` swap operations
on it, and after each swap operation print the in-order traversal
of the current state of the tree.

## Function Description

Complete the `swapNodes` function in the editor below.
It should return a two-dimensional array where each element
is an array of integers representing the node indices of
an in-order traversal after a swap operation.

`swapNodes` has the following parameter(s):
- indexes: an array of integers representing index values of each
  `node[i]`, beginning with `node[1]`, the first element, as the root.
- queries: an array of integers, each representing a `k` value.

## Input Format

The first line contains `n`, number of nodes in the tree.

Each of the next `n` lines contains two integers, `a` `b`,
where `a` is the index of left child, and `b` is the index
of right child of `i`<sup>th</sup> node.

Note: `-1` is used to represent a null node.

The next line contains an integer, `t`, the size of `queries`.
Each of the next `t` lines contains an integer `queries[i]`,
each being a value `k`.

## Output Format

For each `k`, perform the swap operation and store the indices
of your in-order traversal to your result array.
After all swap operations have been performed,
return your result array for printing.

## Constraints

* `1 <= n <= 1024`
* `1 <= t <= 100`
* Either `a = -1` or `2 <= a <= n`
* Either `b = -1` or `2 <= b <= n`
* The index of a non-null child will always be greater
  than that of its parent.

## Explanation 0

As nodes `2` and `3` have no children, swapping will not have
any effect on them. We only have to swap the child nodes
of the root node.

```
    1   [s]       1    [s]       1   
   / \      ->   / \        ->  / \  
  2   3 [s]     3   2  [s]     2   3
```
Note: `[s]` indicates that a swap operation is done at this depth.

## Explanation 1

Swapping child nodes of node 2 and 3 we get

## Explanation 2

Here we perform swap operations at the nodes whose depth is either 2 or 4 for  and then at nodes whose depth is 4 for .
